The dataset available for download follows the organizational principles in the source materials. Each record contains information about a commodity that moved across the Volta River between 1901 and 1940. The records include quantity information for monthly, quarterly, and yearly time periods, which reflect the original sources. In working with the archival documents, I found that the monthly records contained more detailed information than the records from longer time periods. For this reason, I sought to include as many monthly records as possible. Where available, the record includes a description of the commodity, as well as the location and  direction of movement. The dataset contains a total of 7,735 records.
